  about:             |
   I am interested in **teaching machines** to **understand the semantics** behind a text.
   Specificially, I am interested in Multilingual Lexical Semantics related problems such as **Word Sense Disambiguation**
   and the **automatic generation of semantically-annotated data**.
   Currently, I am a post-doctoral research fellow at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/)
   in the [Linguistic Computing Laboratory](http://lcl.uniroma1.it/) led by
   prof. [Roberto Navigli](http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/) where I carry out my research and
   supervise several amazing master and PhD students.

   Earlier in my life, I got my PhD at Sapienza with a thesis on multilingual approaches to automatically
   induce word sense distributions and generate datasets for Word Sense Disambiguation in multiple languages.
   Reach me out on my social channels that you may find right below. During my PhD I also worked as research
   intern in the Machine Learning team at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com).
