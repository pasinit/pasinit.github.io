- **01-01-2021** New multilingual evaluation suite for Word Sense Disambiguation! Meet [XL-WSD](https://sapienzanlp.github.io/xl-wsd/), 
accepted at AAAI2021.
- **01-11-2020** New multilingual evaluation suite for the Word in Context task. Meet [XL-WiC](https://pilehvar.github.io/xlwic/), accepted
at EMNLP2020.
- **01-11-2020** New English and Multilingual embeddings for word senses, i.e., all WordNet nodes and their corresponding 
in other languages! All thanks to [ARES](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.285.pdf), check it out at EMNLP2020!
- **12-07-2020**: A survey on [The Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck Problem in Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/687)
is now published in the [IJCAI2020](https://ijcai20.org/) proceedings.
- **12-07-2020**: [MuLaN](https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/mulan), a multilingual approach to transfer semantic annotations
 from English to other languages (tested in DE ES FR and IT) has been published at [IJCAI2020](https://ijcai20.org/).
- **05-05-2020**: [CluBERT](https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/clubert) accepted at [ACL2020](https://acl2020.org/). CluBERT is a 
cluster-based approach for automatically inducing the distribution of word senses from a corpus of raw texts.
We tested on 5 different languages, i.e., English, French, German, Italian and Spanish and release the distributions
of lexemes in the test sets at [https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/clubert](https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/clubert). 
More data will be soon released!

- **12-02-2020**: [Poster](papers/csi_aaai2020_poster.pdf) of [CSI](papers/lacerra_etal_aaai2020.pdf) AAAI2020 paper.
- **10-01-2020**: I am part of the organizing committee of [EurNLP](https://www.eurnlp.org/) 2020!
- **22-11-2019**: [AAAI 2020](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-20/) papers are out!!!
  - [**SensEmBERT:Context-Enhanced Sense Embeddings for Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation**](papers/scarlini_etal_aaai2020.pdf), joint work with [Bianca Scarlini](https://twitter.com/biancascarlini)
  and [Roberto Navigli](wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli). We present a knowledge-based approach for producing sense embeddings in multiple languages that lay in the same semantic space of BERT contextualised embeddings.
  Our embeddings achieve SOTA results on all WSD datasets for English and 4 other languages. **Stay tuned for website and data!**
  - [**CSI: A Coarse Sense Inventory for 85% Word Sense Disambiguation**](papers/lacerra_etal_aaai2020.pdf), joint work with [Caterina Lacerra](https://twitter.com/CaterinaLac), 
  [Michele Bevilacqua](https://twitter.com/MicheleBevila20) and [Roberto Navigli](wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli). 
  We present a new organization of concepts based on a large-scale mapping of WordNet synsets to domain-based semantic labels. Our new coarse-grained 
  inventory of semantic labels proved to be more descriptive for humans than other competitors and aided a BERT-based WSD model to attain more than 85% accuracy.  
  **Our new coarse-grained inventory along with the mapping to WordNet synsets will be available soon!**
- **16-11-2019**: Two papers accepted at [AAAI 2020](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-20/) !!**: SensEmBERT with [Bianca Scarlini](https://twitter.com/biancascarlini)
and [Roberto Navigli](wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli) and CSI with [Caterina Lacerra](https://twitter.com/CaterinaLac), [Michele Bevilacqua](https://twitter.com/MicheleBevila20) 
and [Roberto Navigli](wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli). Data and preprints will be available soon. In the meanwhile, check out my [tweet](https://twitter.com/pasini_t/status/1193692057795203072) for a breef description
