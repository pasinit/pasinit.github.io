  abstract: >
    We present WiBi, an approach to the
    automatic creation of a bitaxonomy for
    Wikipedia, that is, an integrated taxonomy of Wikipage pages and categories.
    We leverage the information available in
    either one of the taxonomies to reinforce
    the creation of the other taxonomy. Our
    experiments show higher quality and coverage than state-of-the-art resources like
    DBpedia, YAGO, MENTA, WikiNet and
    WikiTaxonomy. WiBi is available at
    http://wibitaxonomy.org.
